# @deepseek-ai/dsh-agent-default-model

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

The deployment default used when an entry point creates an Agent that has no session-local model selection. `AgentDefaultModelConfig` provides `ctx.agentDefaultModel`; direct entry points such as `dsh --profile headless` and Host-backed entry points such as ApiProxy read the same service instead of owning parallel provider/model defaults.

The plugin config requires `{ provider, model }`. That composition entry is the base of the `agent-default-model` Settings section; a mounted settings provider layers the user's choice over it and changes are visible on the next `currentSelection()` read. `reasoningEffort` belongs to the Settings section but deliberately not to plugin config: a complete saved selection can clear an effort when the next selected model has none, while a composition value would be inherited again.

- `ctx.agentDefaultModel.currentSelection()` returns a detached `{ provider, model, reasoningEffort? }` selection for a newly created Agent.
- `ctx.agentDefaultModel.saveSelection(selection)` saves the complete user selection. Without a settings provider it is a no-op and the composition entry remains current.

The service does not validate catalog membership. A provider route may serve an unadvertised model, and the consumer that actually opens a model request owns availability diagnostics.

The optional `auxiliaryModels` composition policy enables the `agent-model-roles` settings namespace. Each title, compression, vision, worker or review entry supplies provider, model, optional reasoning effort and explicit external consent. Consumers resolve the assignment before logging a request or creating a child. Missing entries retain their consumer's existing inheritance; absent composition opt-in preserves laboratories. Only deployment-declared `localProviders` are trusted as local, including when an endpoint uses localhost. Other routes require `allowExternal: true`. This policy grants no tool permissions, monetary budget or extra agents. Changing a role affects its next call or newly created child; cross-model cache reuse is not guaranteed.

## Model Experience

Indirectly, through the provider/model selection supplied to an entry point; request assembly and adapters own the model-visible request.

#### KV Cache effect

Changing the default affects only Agents that subsequently resolve from it. An existing session whose request log already names a selection keeps that selection, so this service does not invalidate its established prefix.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- The service owns one process-wide default; per-session selection remains the entry point's responsibility.
- Without a settings provider, `saveSelection()` cannot retain a selection for a later Agent.
